## about me
* I am currently an assistant professor by special appointment (特任助教) working with [Prof. Imari Sato](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/faculty/digital_content/sato_imari/) at <a href='https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/'>National Institute of Informatics (NII)</a>, Tokyo, Japan. Prior to this, I was a researcher by special appointment (特任研究員) at NII (Aug. 2024 - Feb. 2025).
* I received my Ph.D. (Sept. 2019 - Jul. 2024) from [Peking University (PKU)](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Chao Xu](https://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/info/1177/1375.htm) and [Prof. Boxin Shi](https://camera.pku.edu.cn/team). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor degree in 2019 from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/). 
* My research interest includes computational photography and computer vision, with a focus on unconventional camera-based vision (e.g., polarization-based vision, event-based vision, etc.).
